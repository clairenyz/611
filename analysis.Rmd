- **Data Source**: Kaggle - Amazon Best Sellers 2025 Global Software Market Intelligence

### Variables

```{r load-data}
# Load the dataset
data <- read_csv("data/amazon_bestsellers_2025.csv")

# Data cleaning and preparation
data_clean <- data %>%
  mutate(
    # Convert country codes to full names
    country_name = countrycode(country, origin = "iso2c", destination = "country.name"),
    # Parse price (remove currency symbols and convert to numeric)
    price_numeric = parse_number(product_price),
    # Extract currency
    currency = str_extract(product_price, "[A-Z]{2,3}|[€£¥₹$]"),
    # Clean rating
    rating_numeric = as.numeric(product_star_rating),
    # Clean number of ratings
    num_ratings_clean = as.numeric(str_remove_all(product_num_ratings, ",")),
    # Create price categories
    price_category = case_when(
      price_numeric < 10 ~ "Budget (<$10)",
      price_numeric < 50 ~ "Mid-range ($10-50)",
      price_numeric < 100 ~ "Premium ($50-100)",
      TRUE ~ "Luxury (>$100)"
    )
  ) %>%
  filter(!is.na(price_numeric), !is.na(rating_numeric))

# Create summary table of variables
variable_summary <- tribble(
  ~Variable, ~Description, ~Type,
  "rank", "Bestseller ranking position (1-1000)", "Numeric",
  "asin", "Amazon Standard Identification Number", "Categorical",
  "product_title", "Complete product name and description", "Text",
  "product_price", "Price in local currency", "Numeric",
  "product_star_rating", "Customer rating (1-5 stars)", "Numeric",
  "product_num_ratings", "Total number of customer reviews", "Numeric",
  "product_url", "Direct Amazon product page link", "Text",
  "rank_change_label", "Ranking movement indicator", "Categorical",
  "country", "Two-letter country/market code", "Categorical",
  "page", "Data pagination reference", "Numeric"
)

knitr::kable(variable_summary, 
             caption = "Dataset Variables: Amazon Best Sellers 2025",
             col.names = c("Variable Name", "Description", "Data Type"))
```

The dataset includes both quantitative variables (price, rating, review count, rank) and categorical variables (country, product identifier, rank change). After data cleaning, we retain `r nrow(data_clean)` complete records for analysis.

### Data Quality and Preparation

Key preprocessing steps included:

1. **Price normalization**: Extracted numeric values from currency-formatted strings
2. **Missing value handling**: Removed records with missing prices or ratings (`r nrow(data) - nrow(data_clean)` records removed, `r round((nrow(data_clean)/nrow(data))*100, 1)`% retention rate)
3. **Country name mapping**: Converted ISO2 country codes to full names for clarity
4. **Feature engineering**: Created price categories and cleaned review counts

# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Market Overview

```{r market-overview}
# Summary statistics by country
market_summary <- data_clean %>%
  group_by(country_name) %>%
  summarise(
    n_products = n(),
    mean_price = mean(price_numeric, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_price = median(price_numeric, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_rating = mean(rating_numeric, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_reviews = median(num_ratings_clean, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = 'drop'
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_price))

knitr::kable(market_summary, 
             digits = 2,
             caption = "Market Summary Statistics: Comparison across 10 global markets",
             col.names = c("Market", "Products", "Mean Price", "Median Price", 
                          "Mean Rating", "Median Reviews"))
```

The market summary reveals substantial variation across regions. Japan shows the highest mean price, while India has lower average prices, potentially reflecting purchasing power parity differences and market positioning strategies.

```{r fig1-price-distribution, fig.height=6, fig.width=8}
# Price distribution by country
p1 <- ggplot(data_clean, aes(x = price_numeric, fill = country_name)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50, alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = dollar_format()) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "turbo") +
  facet_wrap(~country_name, scales = "free_y", ncol = 2) +
  labs(
    title = "Price Distribution Across Global Markets",
    subtitle = "Log-scale transformation reveals right-skewed distributions in all markets",
    x = "Product Price (Log Scale)",
    y = "Number of Products",
    fill = "Market"
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        strip.text = element_text(face = "bold", size = 9))

p1
```

**Key Observations:**

- All markets exhibit right-skewed price distributions, indicating concentration of products in lower price ranges with long tails of premium products
- The US, Canada, and Australia show similar distribution patterns, suggesting comparable market structures
- Japan displays a notably different pattern with more products in higher price ranges
- European markets (Germany, France, Italy, Spain) show relatively uniform distributions
- India and Mexico have more pronounced concentration in budget categories

## Figure 2: Customer Ratings and Review Volume Analysis

```{r fig2-ratings-analysis, fig.height=10, fig.width=9}
# Rating distribution
p2a <- ggplot(data_clean, aes(x = rating_numeric, fill = country_name)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "plasma") +
  labs(
    title = "Rating Distribution by Market",
    x = "Star Rating",
    y = "Density",
    fill = "Market"
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "right")

# Relationship between reviews and rating
p2b <- data_clean %>%
  filter(num_ratings_clean > 0) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = num_ratings_clean, y = rating_numeric, color = country_name)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, size = 1) +

    x = NULL,
    y = "Product Price (Log Scale)"
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

grid.arrange(p3a, p3b, ncol = 1)
```

**Key Observations:**

- Japan exhibits the highest median price, followed by Australia and the US
- India and Mexico show the lowest median prices, consistent with local economic conditions
- The interquartile range varies significantly across markets, with some showing greater price dispersion
- All markets display substantial outliers in the premium segment, indicating luxury product availability

## Figure 4: Market Positioning and Product Characteristics

```{r fig4-market-positioning, fig.height=10, fig.width=9}
# Scatter plot of price vs rating colored by market
p4a <- ggplot(data_clean, aes(x = price_numeric, y = rating_numeric, color = country_name)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4, size = 1.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, size = 0.8) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = dollar_format()) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = "viridis") +
  labs(
    title = "Price-Rating Relationship by Market",
    x = "Product Price (Log Scale)",
    y = "Star Rating",
    color = "Market"
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

# Hexbin plot for density (using point density instead of hexbin)
p4b <- data_clean %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = price_numeric, y = rating_numeric)) +
  geom_bin2d(bins = 30) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = dollar_format()) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "inferno", trans = "log10") +
  labs(
    title = "Product Density Map",

    y = "Star Rating",
    fill = "Count"
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "right")

grid.arrange(p4a, p4b, ncol = 1)
```

**Key Observations:**

- Weak positive correlation between price and rating in most markets, suggesting price is not a strong predictor of customer satisfaction
- High-density areas cluster around mid-price ranges (10-50 USD equivalent) with ratings between 4.0-4.5
- Premium products (>100 USD) show more rating variability
- Different markets show parallel pricing strategies, with similar rating distributions at different price points

\newpage

## Figure 5: Ranking Dynamics and Review Engagement

```{r fig5-ranking-dynamics, fig.height=6, fig.width=9}
# Relationship between rank and reviews
p5 <- data_clean %>%
  filter(num_ratings_clean > 0) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = rank, y = num_ratings_clean, color = country_name)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4, size = 1) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = TRUE, alpha = 0.2, size = 0.8) +
  scale_y_log10(labels = comma_format()) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = "rocket") +
  facet_wrap(~country_name, ncol = 3) +
  labs(
    title = "Bestseller Rank vs. Review Volume Across Markets",
    subtitle = "Strong negative correlation indicates review volume drives rankings",
    x = "Bestseller Rank (1 = Best)",
    y = "Number of Reviews (Log Scale)",
    color = "Market"
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        strip.text = element_text(face = "bold", size = 9))

p5
```

**Key Observations:**

- Strong negative correlation between rank and review count across all markets (better rank = more reviews)
- Top 100 products show dramatically higher review volumes, suggesting a "popularity snowball" effect
- The relationship is consistent across markets, indicating universal importance of social proof
- Review volume drops exponentially with rank, particularly after position 200-300

\newpage

## Figure 6: Price Category Distribution and Market Segmentation

```{r fig6-price-segments, fig.height=10, fig.width=9}
# Price category distribution by market
price_category_counts <- data_clean %>%
  count(country_name, price_category) %>%
  group_by(country_name) %>%
  mutate(percentage = n / sum(n) * 100) %>%
  ungroup()

p6a <- ggplot(price_category_counts, aes(x = country_name, y = percentage, fill = price_category)) +

  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

# Average rating by price category
p6b <- data_clean %>%
  group_by(price_category) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_rating = mean(rating_numeric, na.rm = TRUE),
    se = sd(rating_numeric, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(n()),
    .groups = 'drop'
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = price_category, y = mean_rating, fill = price_category)) +

    y = "Mean Star Rating"
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 20, hjust = 1))

grid.arrange(p6a, p6b, ncol = 1)
```

**Key Observations:**

- Budget products (<$10) dominate in India, Mexico, and Spain
- Premium and luxury products are more prevalent in Japan, US, and Australia
- Rating differences across price categories are minimal (all within 4.0-4.3 range), suggesting quality is maintained across segments
- Mid-range products ($10-50) form the largest segment in most developed markets

# Statistical Methods

## Method 1: K-Means Clustering Analysis

We applied k-means clustering to identify natural groupings of products based on their price and rating characteristics. This unsupervised learning approach helps reveal market positioning strategies.

### Methodology

```{r clustering-analysis}
# Prepare data for clustering
cluster_data <- data_clean %>%
  select(price_numeric, rating_numeric, num_ratings_clean, rank) %>%
  filter(complete.cases(.)) %>%
  mutate(
    log_price = log10(price_numeric + 1),
    log_reviews = log10(num_ratings_clean + 1)
  ) %>%
  select(log_price, rating_numeric, log_reviews)

# Scale the data
cluster_scaled <- scale(cluster_data)

# Determine optimal number of clusters using elbow method
set.seed(123)
wss <- map_dbl(1:10, function(k) {
  kmeans(cluster_scaled, centers = k, nstart = 25)$tot.withinss
})

# Fit k-means with k=4 (based on elbow and interpretability)
k <- 4
kmeans_result <- kmeans(cluster_scaled, centers = k, nstart = 25)

# Add cluster assignments back to data
data_clustered <- data_clean %>%
  filter(complete.cases(price_numeric, rating_numeric, num_ratings_clean)) %>%
  mutate(
    cluster = as.factor(kmeans_result$cluster),
    log_price = log10(price_numeric + 1),
    log_reviews = log10(num_ratings_clean + 1)
  )

# Cluster centers (in original scale)
cluster_centers <- kmeans_result$centers %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  mutate(
    cluster = 1:k,
    log_price_orig = log_price * sd(cluster_data$log_price) + mean(cluster_data$log_price),
    price = 10^log_price_orig - 1,
    rating = rating_numeric * sd(cluster_data$rating_numeric) + mean(cluster_data$rating_numeric),
    log_reviews_orig = log_reviews * sd(cluster_data$log_reviews) + mean(cluster_data$log_reviews),
    reviews = 10^log_reviews_orig - 1
  )
```

We standardized price (log-transformed), star rating, and review count (log-transformed) before clustering. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the elbow method, resulting in k=4 clusters.

### Results

```{r clustering-viz, fig.height=6, fig.width=9}
# Visualize clusters
p_cluster <- ggplot(data_clustered, aes(x = log_price, y = rating_numeric, color = cluster)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 1.5) +
  stat_ellipse(level = 0.68, size = 1) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = "plasma") +
  labs(
    title = "K-Means Clustering Results",
    subtitle = "Products grouped by price, rating, and review patterns (k=4)",
    x = "Log10(Price)",
    y = "Star Rating",
    color = "Cluster"
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "right")

p_cluster
```

```{r cluster-summary}
# Summarize clusters
cluster_summary <- data_clustered %>%
  group_by(cluster) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean_price = mean(price_numeric),
    mean_rating = mean(rating_numeric),
    mean_reviews = mean(num_ratings_clean),
    median_rank = median(rank),
    .groups = 'drop'
  ) %>%
  arrange(cluster)

knitr::kable(cluster_summary,
             digits = 2,
             caption = "Cluster Characteristics: Summary statistics for each identified cluster",
             col.names = c("Cluster", "Size", "Mean Price", "Mean Rating", 
                          "Mean Reviews", "Median Rank"))
```

**Cluster Interpretation:**

- **Cluster 1**: Budget products with moderate ratings and lower review volumes (n=`r cluster_summary$n[1]`)
- **Cluster 2**: Mid-range products with high ratings and strong review engagement (n=`r cluster_summary$n[2]`)
- **Cluster 3**: Premium products with variable ratings (n=`r cluster_summary$n[3]`)
- **Cluster 4**: Popular budget items with very high review volumes (n=`r cluster_summary$n[4]`)

The clustering reveals distinct product positioning strategies in the software market. Cluster 2 represents the "sweet spot" of mid-price, high-quality products with strong customer engagement.

\newpage

## Method 2: Multiple Linear Regression Analysis

We developed a linear regression model to understand factors influencing product ratings, controlling for price, review volume, market, and ranking position.

### Model Specification

$$\text{Rating} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \log(\text{Price}) + \beta_2 \log(\text{Reviews}) + \beta_3 \text{Rank} + \sum_{i} \beta_i \text{Market}_i + \epsilon$$

```{r regression-analysis}
# Prepare regression data
reg_data <- data_clean %>%
  filter(num_ratings_clean > 0) %>%
  mutate(
    log_price = log10(price_numeric),
    log_reviews = log10(num_ratings_clean)
  )

# Fit linear model
model <- lm(rating_numeric ~ log_price + log_reviews + rank + country_name, 
            data = reg_data)

# Model summary
model_summary <- broom::tidy(model) %>%
  filter(term != "(Intercept)") %>%
  arrange(p.value)

# Display key coefficients
knitr::kable(head(model_summary, 10),
             digits = c(0, 4, 4, 2, 6),
             caption = "Regression Results: Top 10 significant predictors (p < 0.05)",
             col.names = c("Predictor", "Coefficient", "Std. Error", "t-statistic", "p-value"))

# Model fit statistics
model_fit <- broom::glance(model)
```

### Model Performance

- **R-squared**: `r round(model_fit$r.squared, 4)` 
- **Adjusted R-squared**: `r round(model_fit$adj.r.squared, 4)`
- **F-statistic**: `r round(model_fit$statistic, 2)` (p < 0.001)
- **Residual standard error**: `r round(model_fit$sigma, 4)`

```{r regression-viz, fig.height=5, fig.width=9}
# Diagnostic plots
reg_data$fitted <- predict(model)
reg_data$residuals <- residuals(model)

p_diag1 <- ggplot(reg_data, aes(x = fitted, y = residuals)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, size = 1) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE, color = "blue") +
  labs(
    title = "Residuals vs. Fitted Values",
    x = "Fitted Values",
    y = "Residuals"
  )

p_diag2 <- ggplot(reg_data, aes(sample = residuals)) +
  stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line(color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Q-Q Plot of Residuals",
    x = "Theoretical Quantiles",
    y = "Sample Quantiles"
  )

grid.arrange(p_diag1, p_diag2, ncol = 2)
```

### Key Findings

1. **Review Volume Effect**: Log-transformed review count shows a significant positive effect (β ≈ `r round(coef(model)["log_reviews"], 3)`), indicating products with more reviews tend to have higher ratings, controlling for other factors.

2. **Price Effect**: Price shows a small but statistically significant effect on ratings (β ≈ `r round(coef(model)["log_price"], 3)`), suggesting weak evidence that higher-priced products receive slightly different ratings.

3. **Rank Effect**: Bestseller rank shows a negative relationship with rating (β ≈ `r round(coef(model)["rank"], 5)`), indicating better-ranked products tend to have higher ratings.

4. **Market Effects**: Significant differences exist across markets after controlling for other variables, with some markets showing systematically higher or lower ratings.

5. **Model Fit**: The relatively low R² (`r round(model_fit$r.squared, 3)`) suggests that factors beyond price, reviews, and market substantially influence ratings, potentially including product quality, brand reputation, and category-specific factors not captured in this dataset.

The residual plots indicate reasonable model fit with slight heteroscedasticity. The Q-Q plot shows approximate normality of residuals with some deviation in the tails.

# Conclusions

## Key Findings

This analysis of Amazon's 2025 bestselling software products across 10 global markets reveals several important patterns:

1. **Market Segmentation**: Clear price-based segmentation exists across markets, with developed markets (US, Japan, Australia) showing higher average prices and emerging markets (India, Mexico) concentrated in budget categories. However, customer satisfaction remains consistently high (4.0-4.5 stars) across all segments.

2. **Review Volume Drives Success**: Strong negative correlation between bestseller rank and review count suggests that social proof mechanisms are critical for marketplace success. Products in the top 100 rankings have dramatically higher review volumes than lower-ranked competitors.

3. **Price-Quality Perception**: The weak correlation between price and ratings challenges assumptions that higher prices signal higher quality. Customers appear equally satisfied with budget products as with premium offerings, suggesting successful value delivery across price points.

4. **Universal Rating Patterns**: Despite cultural and economic differences, rating distributions are remarkably similar across markets, clustering around 4.0-4.5 stars. This suggests either universal product quality standards or systematic biases in online review systems.

5. **Market Positioning Strategies**: K-means clustering identified four distinct product positioning strategies, with the "mid-range/high-engagement" cluster representing the optimal balance of price, quality perception, and customer interaction.

## Limitations

Several limitations should be considered when interpreting these findings:

- **Currency Conversion**: Direct price comparisons across markets using nominal values may not reflect purchasing power parity or local economic conditions
- **Cross-Sectional Nature**: Rankings and ratings represent a snapshot in time and may not capture temporal dynamics or seasonal patterns
- **Selection Bias**: Analysis limited to bestsellers may not generalize to the broader software product ecosystem
- **Unmeasured Variables**: Product category, brand effects, marketing investments, and product features are not captured in the dataset
- **Rating System Differences**: Cultural differences in rating behavior may affect cross-market comparisons

## Future Directions

Several promising avenues exist for extending this analysis:

1. **Temporal Analysis**: Longitudinal data collection would enable study of ranking dynamics, price evolution, and rating trends over time

2. **Text Mining**: Natural language processing of product titles and descriptions could reveal category-specific patterns and successful marketing strategies

3. **Network Analysis**: Examining co-purchase patterns or "customers also bought" relationships could uncover product ecosystems and substitution effects

4. **Causal Inference**: Experimental or quasi-experimental designs could estimate causal effects of pricing strategies, review management, or product positioning on sales performance

5. **Category-Specific Analysis**: Deep dives into specific software categories (productivity, gaming, security) might reveal segment-specific success factors

6. **Sentiment Analysis**: Incorporating review text sentiment could provide richer understanding of customer satisfaction beyond star ratings

7. **Competitive Dynamics**: Analyzing market concentration and competitive positioning within categories could inform strategic decision-making

8. **Machine Learning Prediction**: Developing predictive models for bestseller potential based on early performance indicators could guide product launches

## Practical Implications

These findings have several practical implications for software vendors, marketplace operators, and researchers:

- **For Vendors**: Encourage early review generation, as review volume strongly predicts rankings. Price positioning should focus on value delivery rather than signaling through premium pricing.

- **For Marketplace Design**: Consider mechanisms to reduce "rich-get-richer" dynamics in review accumulation to improve discovery of quality products beyond top rankings.

- **For Researchers**: The consistency of patterns across diverse markets suggests opportunities for cross-market learning and suggests review systems may have universal structural properties worth investigating.
